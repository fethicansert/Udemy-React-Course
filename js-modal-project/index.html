        <p>
            Watching the video that you sent me<br>
            The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping<br>
            You know that I'm obsessed with your body<br>
            But it's the way you smile that does it for me<br>
            It's so sweet, knowing that you love me<br>
            Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet<br>
            Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair<br>
            It's so sweet<br>
            Watching the video where you're lying<br>
            In your red lingerie ten times nightly<br>
            You know I think your skin's the perfect color<br>
            But it's always your eyes that pull me under<br>
            It's so sweet, knowing that you love me<br>
            Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet<br>
            Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair<br>
            It's so sweet<br>
            And I will gladly break it<br>
            I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
            And I will gladly break it<br>
            I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
            And I will gladly break it<br>
            I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
            And I will gladly break it<br>
            I will gladly break my heart for you<br>
            It's so sweet, knowing that you love me<br>
            Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet<br>
            Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair<br>
            It's so sweet<br>
